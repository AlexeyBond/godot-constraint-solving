class_name WFCProblem
## Base class for classes representing problems solvable by [WFCSolver].

## Returns number of cells (variables) this problem contains.
func get_cell_count() -> int:

## Returns default domain (set of allowed values) of a cell/variable.

## It usually is a [WFCBitSet] of certain size filled with [code]1[/code]s.

## A [WFCProblem] may limit initial domains of some cells here.

## Computes a domain of given cell.
## [br]
## Usually called by solver when some of cells, [param _cell_id] depends on has changed.

## Called by solver when domain of cell [param _changed_cell_id] has changed.
## The [WFCProblem] should mark all cells that depend on the changed cell by calling
## [param _mark_cell] with ids of those cells (one call with single parameter per cell).

## Represents a part of [WFCProblem] as returned by [method WFCProblem.split].

## Split this problem into few smaller problems that can be solved concurrently.
## [br]
## By default (if not overridden by WFCProblem subclass) just returns a single sub-problem,

## This method is used by [WFCMultithreadedSolverRunner] to distribute work across multiple threads.

## Chose a tile to be observed in some cell.

## By default picks a random element.
## Can be customized to take probabilities into account.
