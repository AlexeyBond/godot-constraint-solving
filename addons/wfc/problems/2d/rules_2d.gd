var mapper: WFCMapper2D

## If enabled, the rules will try to infer some additional allowed transitions when learning from
## sample.
## [br]
## This is done by calling [method WFCBitMatrix.complete] on each matrix in [member axis_matrices].
@export
var complete_matrices: bool = true

## Offsets from a cell to other cells that cell depends on.
## [br]
## By default it's [code](0,1)[/code] and [code](1,0)[/code], so each cell depends on it's
## neighbours along X and Y axes.
## However, one may want a cell to depend, for example, on it's diagonal neighbours.
## In such case one should add [code](1,1)[/code] and [code](1,-1)[/code] to this list.
## [br]
## Another (and, perhaps, more meaningful) use-case is a hexagonal grid.
## In case of hexagonal grid we want a cell to depend on neighbours in three directions, so third
## vector should be added.
## The exact vector depends on chosen coordinate system - for example, in case of [TileMap]s it is
## determined by [member TileSet.tile_layout].
## Note that this WFC implementation won't work with some layouts.
## [br]
## [b]Note:[/b] Any additional element in this array will have a significant impact on performance
## of the solver as it proportionally increases number of constraints.
## [br]
## [b]Note:[/b] This array should not include vectors opposite to other vectors contained here.
## E.g. if [code](1,0)[/code] is here then [code](-1,0)[/code] should not.
## In fact opposite vectors are incluged implicitly because all constraints are symmetric.

## [codeblock]
## AA AB BB
