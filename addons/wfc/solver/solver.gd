class_name WFCSolver
## Solver that solves finite discrete
## [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem]constraint satisfaction problems[/url].
## [br]
## This solver uses backtracking along with
## [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC-3_algorithm]AC-3[/url]-like constraint propagetion
## algorithm.
## [br]
## Despite [code]WFC[/code] prefix in the name, this solver is capable of solving wider range of
## problems than just wave function collapse.
## In fact, wave function collapse is a special case of that wider class of constraint satisfaction
## problems.
## Specifically, such problems are described by following properties:
## [ul]
## finite number of variables
## each variable may have one value from finite set of values
## [/ul]
## The solver assumes that there is a finite set of values and each variable may have any of those
## values. However a problem implementation may limit domains of some variables by implementing
## [method WFCProblem.populate_initial_state].
## [br]
## Since this addon is biased towards WFC, variables are usually named "cells" and values are
## sometimes called "tiles".

## and when solver is allowed to fallback from backtracking to quick and dirty solution method.
